## About Operation Furbaby
Operation Furbaby, Mission Pawsible! Welcome agents to our spy themed pet adoption site. Your mission should you choose to accept is navigating our website and it's features.

1. Landing Page: 
* Features a title and logo along with a mission statement. 
* Six pets to choose from and a description when the user hovers their mouse over each portrait. 
* Below each portrait is a button titled "Select Operative" when clicked the user will be redirected to a adoption form to fill out. 

2. The Form:
* When redirected to the adoption form the user fills out basic information like name, address and which pet they are interested in.
* Once information is submitted a modal comes up displaying the information the user entered and asking the user to verify.
* If the information is correct a confirmation modal comes up and the form is cleared.
* If information is not correct and the user clicks cancel the modal closes and the user may correct any mistakes on the form.
* User information is stored in localstorage and may be viewed with GoogleChrome Dev tools.

3. Using Dev tools to view information in localstorage:
* Right click on form page.
* Scroll down to "inspect" option which will open up the DOM.
* At the top click on the "Application" tab.
* In the left window under "Storage" click on the "Local Storage" drop down select the first option.
* In the main "Application" window you will see the key "applicationData" and the left of it under value the user data stored in a string.

**Technologies Used:**
* HTML - To build the skeleton that will provide a basic layout and allow other technologies to operate.
* Bootstrap - For it's quick and easy implementation of flexbox, containers, row, alignment, buttons, modals and overall responsive design. 
* CSS - Borders, colors and filling in the gaps where we felt Bootstrap was limiting. 
* Javascript - To allow our website to have a functional form and modals. 
* CDNFonts - Secret agent font.
* WhoCanUse - Optimize our website for visual accessibility.
* Visual Studio Code - IDE for writing our code.  
* OpenAI - Generating a spy themed mission statement and pet descriptions based on user input to save time and energy to put towards more practical aspects of the project. 
    
**Challenges:**
* Bootstrap - It was a helpful framework in terms of responsive web design, buttons, flexbox, and quickly adjusting sizing and margins. It's limited customization still required writing CSS to fill in the gaps.
* Time restraints - The due date along with other responsibilities made it a challenge to expand further on the project. 
* Technical knowledge - We are students so our knowledge of coding is limited. 

**Future Features**
* Fine-tune the mobile adaptability (issue with hover).
* Create a smooth process to easily add future pets.
* Add feature to prompt user to finish filling out form if any information is missing.
* When a user selects a pet and clicks the button to "select operative" the form page will feature a portrait of the pet and the pet info will automatically populate on the form.
* Have videos of the pets.
